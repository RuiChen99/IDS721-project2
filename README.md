# IDS721 project2 -- Book Recommendation
In project 2, the goal was to build a functional web microservice in Rust based on Kubernetes or other similar platforms (Kubernetes deployments provide a higher level of abstraction for managing the deployment and scaling of applications in a cluster, making it easier to automate and manage the process). I've created a simple actix microservice for readers that can be used to randomly select a good classic at their leisure based on a list of the best books in the world in 2022 from Newyorker.com.
